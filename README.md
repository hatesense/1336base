## Message From Authors
but That was a few months ago, things have changed. I’ve actually been bothered to to learn reversing, and stop being a $k1d. You realise that I went from being a $k1d, yoinking basic features to learning nearly 15 languages, decent reversing skills to the point I actually understand what I’m doing, and having good enough C++ knowledge in less than 2 years.
I have no reason to start shit with anyone, but it seems you feel like doing so.
All my stuff now I’ve wrote myself, every project and everything I use I wrote. I rewrote Lua in modern C++, along with other things like STB. I’ve improved MinHook (pretty much a rewrite but sections aren’t mine, and credit should be given where due), and plans to better improve other things too.
I think the only thing I still use I haven’t wrote myself is ImGui, because my users and friends seemed to want it while I share a strong distaste for it. Sure, there is the saying don’t reinvent the wheel. But I couldn’t care less, there’s so many projects that have good ideas but they didn’t quite implement it properly or it could be better
